Welcome to the world of Clair Obscur Expedition 33 by Sandfall Interactive studio. With only a small team of they have
created a masterpiece worthy of a triple A title, and I do not mean that lightly. This is a different style turn based
game and not for those who think they can take it easy. Here I will give you my take and tell you why this is definitely a 
game you should pick up and try it for yourself. I will do my best to avoid a lot of spoilers to those who wish to pick up
the game for themselves. 

## Plot
The game is inspired by Belle Ã‰poque France, where a handful of people live on a large island in the middle of the ocean
called Lumiere. Each year, an unknown entity that is known by the name "the Paintress" would emerge from her slumber off in the distant,
and magically change the number on the monolith. As the number is lowered by one, those of that age would simply vanish this event would be
known as the Gommage. So volunteers would set out and head to the mainland to end the Paintress before she would paint a new number.
This time it is Expedition 33, is hoping to set forth and end things once and for on. 


### Story
The game provides a rich and wonderful obscure mystery that leave you to find out wondering how and what happen. Each character
that you play with have their own story to tell, and what they have lost due to the Gommage event. As you talk to all the
inhabitants and those you met along the journey, you may be left confused and question more on how this came to be. As this
game will make it so that you will be heavily invested in the story of each member, their enemies, and the world they live in.
There are few pieces that you must collect to understand the previous expedition and what had happen to them. Though some
things are not well explain you will have to piece to get the story as you advance further. Overage its beautifully and creatively
well written story.

Rating: 9 out 10

### Gameplay
If you have play Persona 5, Final Fantasy, and Lies of P. Then know you are in the world of hurt. This game is a turn-based game
that leaves you either frustrated or extremely excited for getting those inputs timing correct. Yes, you will not have to wait for
the enemy turn, you will be forced to react to the enemy attacking you. With dodging and parrying, as well as other controls as 
you advance in the game. The mechanics of dodging and parrying is roughly similar to Lies of P where you may feel there is
a input delay. However, if you listen to the audios ques you may have a higher chance of pulling off then just staring and hoping 
you press the button at the right time. You can also shoot enemies, use items, different skills based on the character you have in the party,
and more. You will have endless combination of pictos, which are essentially buffs and effects that can make or break your characters.
Unique skills pertaining and overall you will not be bored trying different combos. So in this incredible game you will either be 
rewarded for your quick reaction or suffer until you beat the enemy at the inch of your life.
