Welcome to the world of Clair Obscur Expedition 33 by Sandal Interactive studio. With only a small team of they have
created a masterpiece worthy of a triple A title, and I do not mean that lightly. This is a different style turn based
game and not for those who think they can take it easy. Here I will give you my take and tell you why this is definitely a 
game you should pick up and try it for yourself. 


## Plot
Clair Obscur Expedition 33 unfolds in a hauntingly beautiful world inspired by the elegance and melancholy of Belle Époque-era France.
Set on an isolated enigmatic island of 'Lumière', life here is governed not by ravage of time, but by a single, towering monolith - its
surface marked by a shifting number that determines the fate of all. 

Each year, without fail, a mysterious entity known only as 'the Paintress' awakens from her distant slumber. With a wave of her hand, she alters
the monolith, lowering the number by one. As it changes, those whose ages matches the new number quietly, inexplicably vanish.
The phenomenon is called the 'Gommage' - a silent erasure, as though lives are being brushed away like pigments from a canvas.

In a desperate attempt to break the cycle, the island's bravest - or perhaps most desperate volunteers embark on a perilous journey
to the mainland, hoping to confront and stop the Paintress before the next number is painter. Many before had tried, none have ever returned.

Now, as the monolith falls on the thirty-third mark, Expedition 33 is assembled and prepare on their final expedition to not just
reach the mainland, but to unearth the truths buried beneath centuries of mystery, and hopefully to end the Gommage once and for all.

### Story
The game weaves a rich and evocative tapestry of mystery, inviting you to uncover its dark secrets at your own pace.
Clair Obscur doesn't hand you the answer, it compels you to explore and seek them. Each character you encounter carries a personal story
shaped by the haunting Gommage. You will travel with them, listen to their stories, reasons and motivation on this expedition. The emotional
depth of your companions and even those you meet briefly along the way, will leave you questioning not just what happened, but why.

As you explore the world, you'll find fragments of the past echoes of the expeditions that came before yours. Some buried deep, while
others deliberately obscured, challenging you to connect the dots. The narrative doesn't reveal anything outright instead, it rewards
the explorer with curiosity to unravel is mystery.

This is a world where mystery breathes, and the line between clarity and shadow is exquisitely blurred.

### Gameplay
If you have play Persona 5, Final Fantasy, and Lies of P. Then know you are in the world of hurt. This game is a turn-based game
that leaves you either frustrated or extremely excited for getting those inputs timing correct. Yes, you will not have to wait for
the enemy turn, you will be forced to react to the enemy attacking you. With dodging and parrying, as well as other controls as 
you advance in the game. The mechanics of dodging and parrying is roughly similar to Lies of P where you may feel there is
an input delay. However, if you listen to the audios ques you may have a higher chance of pulling off then just staring and hoping 
you press the button at the right time. You can also shoot enemies, use items, different skills based on the character you have in the party,
and more. You will have endless combination of pictos, which are essentially buffs and effects that can make or break your characters.
Unique skills pertaining and overall you will not be bored trying different combos. So in this incredible game you will either be 
rewarded for your quick reaction or suffer until you beat the enemy at the inch of your life.

### Music Score
A memorizing melody and banger soundtrack from this game keeps you hook and loving every minute of the game. 
With melancholy and soft tone to an exciting hype music just draws your attention to pay attention to overall 
arching story and the world around the characters. You will not be disappointed how well the music flow from cutscenes to 
boss battle. You have the option to collect music score within the game and listen to them while you rest at camps.
You can just leave it in the background and listen to most song over and over while doing chores. 



### Art & Design
Just as the game is incredible from the world to the character design to skills effects is simply astonishing. The Sandfall team
put in a lot of work making this visually appealing while displaying incredible style of how breathtaking the scenery and the scene
are in the game. While it is well crafted, it is not totally refine. There are few issue during cutscene there certain part of
the character model (e.g. the hair) clips through their body making it look weird. However, it is a minor flaw that should not 
detract or make the game unplayable.

### Verdict 
Riveting and exciting hype that blows gamer expectation out of the waters. If you enjoy a good real-time strategy turn-based action game,
then this is a must pick game for you. However, it is not for the faint of hearts. You either must get good or fall into the despair as journey
