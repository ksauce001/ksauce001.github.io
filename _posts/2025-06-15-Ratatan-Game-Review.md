From the creative minds behind Patapon 1, 2, and 3, Ratatan marks a bold return to rhythm-based gameplay—this time infused with roguelite elements. 
Originally funded via Kickstarter, Ratatan is now available in demo form on Steam. Having played both the closed beta and the demo, 
I came away intrigued, entertained, and cautiously optimistic about what’s to come.


### The World

Set in the whimsically mysterious world of The Everafter, Ratatan invites players into a side-scrolling rhythm adventure brimming with charm. 
Visually, the game nails its aesthetic: clean, colorful, and packed with personality. You'll guide your battalion of Cobun through procedurally 
generated stages filled with enemies, hazards, and the occasional larger-than-life boss.

While the current demo offers only two worlds, there's enough variety and detail to hint at a much more expansive universe in the full release. 
The pacing encourages exploration without overwhelming the player, and the clever art direction gives each level a distinct flavor. 

### Gameplay

If you’re familiar with Patapon, you’ll feel right at home—Ratatan keeps the core formula: issue rhythmic commands to your troops to march, 
attack, defend, and more. That said, it leans toward accessibility this time around. Inputs are a bit more forgiving, and keeping the rhythm 
feels easier overall.

However, don’t mistake that for a lack of challenge. Combat encounters scale in difficulty quickly, and strategic resource management becomes
key to progression. Between levels, you’ll unlock skills, items, and upgrades that improve your chances of survival. There’s a grind to gear
up your army properly, which fits the roguelite structure but might deter those looking for a more straightforward experience.

Steam Deck players may find the beat easier to follow due to tactile controls, while PC players might need to adjust settings to achieve 
the same level of responsiveness. There is multiplayer support, but at this stage, it’s still a bit rough around the edges. Bugs and connection 
issues need addressing, but the foundation is promising.

### Music

At the heart of Ratatan is its soundtrack—and for the most part, it delivers. The music is lively, thematic, and helps maintain energy during longer sessions. 
However, when rhythm timing slips—especially during tense boss encounters—the soundtrack can become grating rather than motivating. That’s more a consequence 
of pacing than composition, but it’s something players will notice.

Fortunately, different biomes bring new tracks, keeping the audio experience from going stale. It’s clear the music is meant to be a core driver 
of both gameplay and mood, and with a few refinements, it could become one of the game’s standout features. 

### Conclusion
Ratatan isn’t trying to be Patapon 4, and that’s a good thing. It borrows what worked, trims the fat, and adds its own twist to create something familiar 
yet fresh. While it still needs polish—particularly in its multiplayer functionality and musical transitions—it’s a strong foundation that could blossom 
into something special.

Whether you’re a fan of the original series or simply curious about rhythm-based games with a roguelite flavor, the demo is worth your time. 
Just know going in: nostalgia might be what brings you to Ratatan, but it’s the new direction that will determine whether it earns a lasting place 
on your playlist.

Early Access will be available on July 25, 2025. So put a reminder on your calendar and keep on rocking.
